## VerifiedBuild

This field was used to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

- If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.
- If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.
- If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.
