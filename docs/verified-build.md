### VerifiedBuild

This field is used by the TrinityCore DB Team to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

- If value is 0, it has not been parsed yet.
- If value is &gt; 0, it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific [Client Build](auth/realmlist#realmlist-gamebuild).
- If value is -1, it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.
- If value is -[Client Build](auth/realmlist#realmlist-gamebuild), it was parsed with WDB files from that specific [client build](auth/realmlist#realmlist-gamebuild) and manually edited later for some specific necessity.
